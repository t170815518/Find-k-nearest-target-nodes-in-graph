# Graph Searching 

*This repository is for Lab project 2, CZ2001, NTU*

## To run mBFS in Python 

1. Python 3 is required. 
2. Run `python3 main.py -d DATASET_DIR`, where `DATASET_DIR` is the **directory** (i.e. not the file) in `dataset` directory. It should contain `graph.txt` and `hospital.txt` for searching.
